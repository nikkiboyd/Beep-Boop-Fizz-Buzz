## Description

_This application utilizes JavaScript and jQuery to allow users to any number to communicate with the Beep Boop Bot. The bot will respond with three different messages depending on what number the user has entered. Can you detect the pattern? Spoilers in "Specifications" section below!_

## Specifications

Program will say "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that." if the input number is divisible by 3.
  - Example Input: "30"
  - Example Output: "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

Program will reply with "Boop!" if the number contains a 1.
  - Example Input: "10"
  - Example Output: "Boop!"

Program will reply with "Beep!" if the number contains a 0.
